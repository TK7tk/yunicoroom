# Platform Comparison: GitHub vs GitLab vs Bitbucket (2025)

## GitHub
- **Best For**: Open Source, Community interaction, General Purpose.
- **Strengths**:
    - Massive community/network effect.
    - GitHub Actions (flexible, large marketplace).
    - AI Leadership (Copilot).
    - Security features (CodeQL, Secret Scanning) are top-tier.
- **Pricing**: Free tier is very generous. Team/Enterprise plans standard.

## GitLab
- **Best For**: Enterprise, "All-in-One" DevSecOps.
- **Strengths**:
    - Single application for entire lifecycle (Plan -> Code -> Build -> Monitor).
    - CI/CD is built-in and very mature (Auto DevOps).
    - Stronger Self-Managed/On-Premise heritage (though GitHub has Enterprise Server).
- **Weakness**: UI can be complex/cluttered compared to GitHub.

## Bitbucket
- **Best For**: Teams heavily using Jira/Confluence (Atlassian ecosystem).
- **Strengths**:
    - Deep Jira integration (Branch per ticket usage is seamless).
    - Tighter Project Management integration (if using Jira).
- **Weakness**: Smaller community, less focus on Open Source innovation. Actions/Pipelines less vast marketplace.

## Summary Verdict
- **Pick GitHub** if you want the standard, best developer experience, AI tools, and community access.
- **Pick GitLab** if you want a strict, single-tool CI/CD/Ops platform on-premise.
- **Pick Bitbucket** if you live and die by Jira tickets.
