# Source 4: Advanced Collaboration Tips

## Best Practices
- **Branching Strategy**: Use Git Flow or Trunk Review. Protect the `main` branch.
- **Pull Requests**:
    - Keep them small.
    - Use templates for descriptions.
    - Require approvals before merging.
- **Code Review**:
    - Constructive feedback.
    - Automated checks (linting) via Actions.
- **Project Management**:
    - Use GitHub Projects (Kanban).
    - Link Issues to PRs.

## Workflow Optimization
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate "boring" stuff like style checks, release notes, and deployment.
- **CODEOWNERS**: Automatically request review from specific experts for certain files.
