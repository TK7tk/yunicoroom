# GitHub Features & Trends 2025

## Core Evolution
By 2025, GitHub has evolved from a code host to a "Developer Command Center" or "AI-First Developer Ecosystem".

## AI Integration (The Big Shift)
- **GitHub Copilot X & GPT-5**:
    - Integration with GPT-5 (expected Aug 2025) suggests massive reasoning improvements.
    - Can implement full modules (auth, reset flows) in single prompts.
    - **Copilot Chat**: Debugging and conversational coding.
    - **Copilot CLI**: Shell command assistance.
    - **Copilot Workspace**: AI-driven repo analysis and planning.

## Security (DevSecOps)
- **Dependabot**: Auto-dependency updates.
- **Secret Scanning**: Detects keys/tokens; now uses AI to find deeper/obfuscated secrets.
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for vulnerabilities.
- **Security Campaigns**: Batch autofix for up to 1000 alerts.
- **Private Vulnerability Reporting**: Safe disclosure channels for Open Source.

## Project Management
- **GitHub Projects (V2)**: Kanban boards, custom fields, automation. Replacing Jira/Trello for many teams.
- **Discussions**: Community forums separate from Issues (bugs).

## Other Key Features
- **Repositories**: The base unit.
- **Pull Requests**: The collaboration core. Drafts, Auto-merge queues.
- **Wikis & Pages**: Documentation and static hosting.
