# Source 1: GitHub General Concepts for Business Beginners

## Overview
GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration, essential for modern business software development. It extends Git (a local version control tool) to the cloud, adding social and project management features.

## Key Concepts
- **Repository (Repo)**: The project folder containing all files and history.
- **Branch**: A parallel version of the repo for working on features/fixes without affecting the main code.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes with a descriptive message.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: A proposal to merge changes from a branch. The heart of collaboration and code review.
- **Issue**: Tickets for tracking bugs, tasks, and feature requests.
- **Discussion**: Forums for open-ended conversations.

## Git vs GitHub
- **Git**: Local command-line tool for version tracking.
- **GitHub**: Cloud service hosting Git repositories + Collaboration tools (Web UI, Access Control, CI/CD).
