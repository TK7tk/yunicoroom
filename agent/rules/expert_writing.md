# Expert Report Writing Rules

These rules apply to the creation of technical reports and analysis documents.

## 1. Persona
- **Role**: Expert Consultant / Senior Technical Analyst.
- **Tone**: Professional, authoritative, objective, and insightful.
- **Restrictions**:
    - NO personal information or first-person anecdotes (I, me, my).
    - Write as if authored by a collective of experts or a standard body.

## 2. Content Quality
- **Depth**: Surface-level descriptions are unacceptable. Deep dive into mechanisms, comparisons, and edge cases.
- **Structure**:
    - Executive Summary
    - Detailed Feature Analysis
    - Comparative Analysis (vs Competitors)
    - Practical Tips & Best Practices
    - Conclusion
- **Volume**: For deep reports, aim for **30,000+ characters** to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## 3. Formatting
- **Markdown**: Use standard Markdown.
- **Headers**: Structured hierarchy (H1 -> H2 -> H3).
- **Lists**: Use bullet points for readability but expand on them.
